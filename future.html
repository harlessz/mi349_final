            <h3>Goal #1 - Solid Job Out of College</h3>
            <p>The first goal I’m looking to achieve after graduating college is to secure a stable, well-paying job within my field. I am currently a senior majoring in Computational Data Science with a minor in Information Technology, so I would love to find a role where I can combine my soft business skills with my data analytics background and education. Ideally the position would allow me to work with real people to solve real problems rather than being confined to a cubicle every day and just tapping away at a keyboard.

            <h3>Goal #2 - Start My Own Business</h3>
            <p>The next goal I plan to target later on in my life would be to start my own business. I would love to be able to meet with customers about their companies  and analyze their data to inform them of ways they could be doing things more efficiently. I am also passionate about charity work and giving back to the community, so I would love to be able to take a certain portion of my company’s profits and automatically donate them to charity - specifically something environmental.

            <h3>Goal #3 - Write a Book</h3>
            <p>
                It has always been a lifelong dream of mine to write a book - in fact I can recall that the very first thing that I wanted to be when I was growing up was an author. There’s just something so fascinating to me about pouring out all your thoughts onto the blank pages, almost as if you’re allowing the reader to peek through a tiny window into your mind. It wouldn’t necessarily have to be any specific genre, but I know that once I decide on a topic and the inspiration hits me, I won’t be able to stop writing.
